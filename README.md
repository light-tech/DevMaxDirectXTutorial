DirectX Tutorial Sample in DevMax
=================================

This sample project in DevMax ports the DirectX SDK tutorial available at https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-samples.git. (See subfolder `Direct3D11Tutorials` in that repo.)

This is to illustrate the capability of DevMax when it comes to developing professional software.

For headers, just copy all the Windows SDK headers and MSVC headers.

For libraries, you will need `libcpmt.lib` (distributed with VC) and `d3d11.lib` (distributed with the Windows SDK).
